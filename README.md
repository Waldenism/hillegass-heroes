# nuzlocke-companion

This project is a companion site for nuzlocke pokemon players. 

What is nuzlocke?

It is a self imposed set of rules for pokemon. There are 2 main rules and many additional rule variants. The ruleset was introduced primarily because players wanted to make the pokemon games more difficult. The ruleset is also favored because it forces players to become more attached to thier pokemon and use pokemon they might not normally otherwise. It makes battleing each of the gym leaders feel more significant. 

1. all pokemon that feint must either be released or placed into a 'graveyard' box in the PC and never used. 
2. you many only catch the first pokemon encountered on each route/game area. If you do not catch that pokemon then you do not get a pokemon for that area. 

Other optional rules include

3. nicnaming all of your pokemon.
