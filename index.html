    <h1>I am a master of Git</h1>
    <span class="blurb"> git can be hard to understand at first, it is an amazing tool used for version control making it easy and possible for many developers to work on the same project. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux OS. He created git so he could more easily work on the Linux kernal with other devs</span>
